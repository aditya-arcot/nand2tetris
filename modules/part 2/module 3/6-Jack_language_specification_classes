== classes ==
basic compilation unit

each class Foo stored in separate Foo.jack file

name of class must start with capital letter

skeleton
	class Foo {
		field variable declarations
		static variable declarations
		subroutine declarations (constructors, methods, functions)
	}

2 categories
- provide functionality
  - libraries of services
  - only functions
  - no fields, constructors, methods
  - ex: Math class - provides various mathematical operations
- represent objects
  - used to represent object type and operations on this object
  - typically contains fields
  - contains at least 1 method
  - can also contain functions
    - recommended for helper purpose only
  - ex: Fraction, List, String, ...

best practice - don't mix libary, object representation in same class
==========


== standard class library / OS ==
purpose
- close gaps between high-level programs and host hardware
- provide efficient implementations of commonly-used functions
- provide efficient implementations of commonly-used ADTs

implementation
- collection of classes
- similar to Java's standard class library 

classes
- Math
- String
- Array
- Output
- Screen
- Keyboard
- Memory
- Sys
