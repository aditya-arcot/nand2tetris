== sprite ==
2-D bitmap
typically integrated into larger scene

challenges
- drawing quickly
- creating smooth animations

solutions
- use standard OS graphics library
- use your own graphics functions
==========


== Hack screen ==
256 x 512 pixels
memory map - 16 bits x 8192 rows

each screen row represented by 32 memory rows
==========


== accessing memory ==
OS Memory class API
- function int peek(int address)
- function void poke(int address, int value)

ex: do Memory.poke(19003, -1)
==========


== custom drawing ==
drawing pixels 1 at a time is very inefficient
- each takes 40 machine operations

instead, write 16 pixels at a time using poke
- only 4 machine operations

bitmap editor
- use to generate Jack code for sprite at relative location
