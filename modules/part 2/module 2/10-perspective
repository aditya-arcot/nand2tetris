2-tier compilation vs direct compilation (ex: C++)
- ends up being more machine code
  - less efficient
- easier to implement for different hosts
- more secure
  - easier to look for security breaches in VM code

VM code treats memory segments as abstractions 
- developers of compilers don't have to worry about host platform
