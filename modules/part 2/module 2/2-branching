previously, VM code flow was only linear

label
- syntax - label labelname

unconditional branching
- syntax - goto labelname
- jumps to execute command just after label

conditional branching
- syntax - if-goto labelname
- push condition to stack before
- pop cond and if cond, jump to execute command just after label

implementation
- translate each branching command into assembly instructions that effect specified operation
- assembly language has similar branching commands, so translation should be trivial
