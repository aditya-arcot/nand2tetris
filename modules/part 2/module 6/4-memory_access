program requirements
- access RAM via abstractions
- access I/O devices via abstractions

low-level services that facilitate direct RAM access

function int peek(int address)
- returns value of given RAM address

function void poke(int address, int value)
- sets value of given RAM address to given value

implementation
- static array ram
- init - let ram = 0	allows for complete access to RAM
- peek - return ram[addr]
- poke - let ram[addr] = val
