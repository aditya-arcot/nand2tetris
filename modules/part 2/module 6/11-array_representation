== Array API ==
Class Array {
  function Array new(int size)
  method void dispose()
}

array processing is done by compiler
==========


== typical usage ==
var Array a, b;
let a = Array.new(3);
let a[2] = 222;
let b = Array.new(50);
let b[1] = a[2] - 100;
do a.dispose();
==========


== implementation notes ==
Array.new implemented as function, not constructor
- no fields, so no need for symbol table lookups by compiler
- must call Memory.alloc since it will not be called

Array.dispose
- Memory.deAlloc
