need to know
- variable type 
- which variable of its kind


variable types
- class-level variables
  - field
  - static
- subroutine-level variables
  - argument
  - local


variable properties in Jack
- name (identifier)
- type (int, char, boolean, class name)
- kind (field, static, argument, local)
- scope


== symbol table ==
used to manage variable properties

need to always maintain 2 symbol tables
- class-level symbol table can be reset for new class
- subroutine-level symbol table can be reset for new subroutine

'this' is always argument 0 for method

handling variable declarations
- field/static/var type varName, arguments
- add variable, properties to symbol table

using variables
- look up in subroutine-level symbol table
- if not found, look up in class-level symbol table
- if still not found, error message
==========


== example - Point class ==
name		type	kind	#
x		int	field	0
y		int	field	1
pointCount	int	static	0

name	type	kind		#
this	Point	argument	0
other	Point	argument	1
dx	int	local		0
dy	int	local		1
==========


== perspective ==
programming languages vary in terms of 
- variable types
- variable kinds
- nested scoping

first 2 are easy to implement with some modifications of symbol table

nested scoping can be managed using linked list of symbol tables
- creation
  - add class-level symbol table to linked list
  - add method-level symbol table to linked list
  - keep adding symbol tables for each new scope level
- lookup
  - start in 1st table
  - if not found, look in next table, and so on
