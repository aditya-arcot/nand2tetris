variable kinds
- ex: argument, local, static
- preserved during compilation through virtual memory segments
  - different segments for different kinds of variables

removes need for preserving variable names
- instead referred only by memory segment location

8 segments
- local
- argument
- this
- that
- constant
- static
- pointer
- temp

syntax - push/pop segment i
- cannot pop from constant segment

ex:
push static 0		// push value at static[0] to stack
push argument 1		// push value at argument[0] to stack
add			// pop last 2 values, add, push to stack
pop local 2		// pop last value, store at local[2]

still only uses 1 stack
