== Hack CPU ==
16-bit processor

functions
- execute current instruction
- figure out which instruction to execute next

connected to instruction & data memory

inputs
- inM (16)
  - value of currently selected data register
- instruction (16)
  - value of currently selected instruction register
- reset (1)
  - restarts program if 1

outputs
- outM (16)
  - data value
- writeM (1)
  - load bit that enables writing
- addressM (16)
  - where to write data
- pc (15)
  - address of next instruction

parts
- A register
- D register
- PC
- ALU
- 2 Mux16
==========


== instruction handling ==
decode into op-code (1) + remaining (15)

A-instruction (op-code 0)
- store value in A-register
- output value (addressM)

C-instruction (op-code 1)
- decode remaining into comp, dest, jump
- run through ALU
==========


== ALU operation ==
data inputs
- from D-register
- from A-register / M-register

control inputs
- control bits from instruction

data output
- possibilities
  - D-register
  - A-register
  - outM
- destination bits determine which register actually receives data output
  - 0 for ignore
  - 1 for accept

control outputs
- zr (1)
- ng (1)
==========


== program counter ==
output address of next instruction

logic
if (reset == 1) PC = 0
else
  load = f(jump bits, ALU control outputs)
  if (load == 1) PC = A
  else PC ++
