Von Neumann
- single memory - data and program
- need 2 cycles
  - can be implemented by State register
- good for general-purpose computer

Harvard
- separate memory units
- single cycle
- good for embedded system, since ROM doesn't change


device controller
- dedicated hardware for managing an I/O device
- takes load off of CPU
