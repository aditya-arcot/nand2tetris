A and C instruction specifications are straight forward to translate

need to be able to translate both pre-defined symbols and user-defined labels and variables

assembly program elements
- white space
  - empty lines / indentation
  - line comments
  - in-line comments
  - block comments
- instructions
  - A
  - C
- symbols
  - references
  - labels

simplifying assumption
- deal with symbols later

handling programs without symbols
- much simpler
- white space
- instructions

plan ahead
- develop basic assembler that translates symbol-less Hack programs
- develop ability to handle symbols
- morph basic assembler into assembler that translates any Hack program
