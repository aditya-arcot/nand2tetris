symbols do not exist in C instructions
only in A instructions and label declarations


== pre-defined symbols ==
23 in Hack language

only in A instructions
==========


== label symbols ==
used to label destination of goto commands

declared by (label_name)

symbol refers to memory location holding next instruction in program
- skip line numbers of declarations
==========


== variable symbols ==
any sumbol which is not pre-defined and is not defined elsewhere using label declaration

each variable assigned unique memory address, starting at 16
==========


== symbol table ==
DS that stores symbol, value pairs

population
- initialize with pre-defined symbols
- 1st pass - run through program to look for label declarations
  - add label symbols to table
- 2nd pass - add variable symbols

usage - look up value to resolve symbol
==========


== assembly process ==
initialization
- construct empty symbol table
- add pre-defined symbols

1st pass
- scan entire program
- for each instruction in form (label)
  - add pair to symbol table

2nd pass
- set n to 16
- scan entire program
- for each instruction
  - if @symbol, look up symbol
    - if found, use value to complete translation
    - if not found
      - add pair to table
      - use n to complete translation
      - n++
  - if C-instruction, complete translation
  - write instruction to output file
