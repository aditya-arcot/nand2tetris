== project 3 ==
given
- all chips built in projects 1, 2
- DFF gate

goal - build following chips
- Bit
- Register (16-bit)
- RAM8
- RAM64
- RAM512
- RAM4K
- RAM16K
- PC

first 7 chips are family of sequential chips
==========


== 8-register RAM ==
take in value and feed to all 8 registers
use Mux, Dmux logic to select right register
==========


for remaining registers, stack previous size RAM


== program counter ==
can be built using register, incrementor, and some logic gates
==========
