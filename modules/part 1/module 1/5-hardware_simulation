== hardware simulation ==
used to test HDL code
	syntax / logical errors


interactive
	start hardware simulator
	load HDL file
	enter values and evaluate chip logic
	inspect resulting values
		output pins
		internal pins
script-based (.tst)
	series of commands to simulator	
		load HDL (ex: load Xor.hdl;)
		tests (ex: set a 0, set b 0, eval;)
	"automatic"
	replicable
	can use output file
		output results to file	
		ex:
			load Xor.hdl, output-file Xor.out, output-list a b out;
			set a 0, set b 0, eval, output;
	can use compare file (.cmp)
		used when manually checking output is infeasible
		ex: load Xor.hdl, output-file Xor.out, compare-to Xor.cmp, output-list a b out;
		created using behavioral simulation
			chip logic can be implemented in any language
			enables high-level planning and testing of hardware arch before writing HDL code

== hardware construction ==
players
	system architects
	developers

system architect decides what lower-level chips are needed
for each chip, architect creates:
	chip API - documentation, interface
	test script
	compare file

developer then build the chips
