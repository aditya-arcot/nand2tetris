== binary addition ==
add bits from right to left
carry bit if greater than 1
	ex: if sum is 2, write 0, carry 1
	ex: if sum is 3, write 1, carry 1
in case of overflow, usually ignore overflow bits
	operation is technically addition mod 2^(width)

== building an adder ==
progression
- half adder - adds 2 bits
- full adder - adds 3 bits
- multi-bit adder - adds 2 numbers

half adder
- inputs - 2 bits - a, b
- outputs - 2 bits - sum, carry
- 1st week 2 implementation exercise

full adder
- inputs - 3 bits - a, b, c (from previous addition)
- outputs - 2 bits - sum, carry
- 2nd implementation exercise

multi-bit adder
- use half adder for first addition
- use full adder for remaining additions
