== ALU ==
inputs - a, b, f
output - f(a,b)

f - one out of family of pre-defined arithmetic and logical functions

determining what operations are defined in the ALU is a hardware / software tradeoff
- ex: can implement multiplication, division in software and not ALU
==========


== Hack ALU ==
inputs - 16-bit x, 16-bit y, 6 control bits (zx, nx, zy, ny, f, no)
outputs - 16-bit function output, 2 additional bits (zr, ng)

operations (in order)
- if zx == 1 then x = 0
- if nx == 1 then x = ~x
- if zy == 1 then y = 0
- if ny == 1 then y = ~y
- if f == 1 then out = x+y, else out = x&y
- if no == 1 then out = ~out
- if out == 0 then zr = 1, else zr = 0
- if out < 0 then ng = 1, else ng = 0

18 possible functions
- 0 1 -1 x y !x !y -x -y x+1 y+1 x-1 y-1 x+y x-y y-x x&y x|y

characteristics
- simple
- elegant
- easy to implement
