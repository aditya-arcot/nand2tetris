basic CPU loop
- fetch instruction from program memory
- execute it


== fetching ==
input location of next instruction to program counter (register)
- data bus
- usually old value + 1
program counter outputs instruction address to program memory
- address bus
program memory outputs instruction code
- data bus
==========


== executing ==
instruction code specifies what to do
- may need to access registers, data memory

different subsets of bits control different aspects of operation
==========


== fetch-execute clash ==
both program and data are in same memory

solution - multiplexer
- switch between storing program counter and data address in memory register
- instruction register used to store current instruction

simpler solution - Harvard architecture
- keep program and data in 2 separate memory modules
- variant of von Neumann architecture
