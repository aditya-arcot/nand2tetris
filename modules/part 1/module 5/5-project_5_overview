Hack computer is a hierarchy of chip parts
- lowest level - elementary logic gates


== CPU implementation ==
chip parts - Mux16, ARegister, DRegister, PC, ALU, ...
control - use HDL subscripting to route instruction bits to control bits of relevant chip-parts

add necessary logic between pieces
==========


== data memory implementation ==
chips - RAM 16K, Screen, Keyboard

if address is in Screen or Keyboard, route to chip relative address
==========


== ROM 32K ==
simpler version of RAM
no write functionality necessary

use built-in chip
==========


== Hack ==
connect CPU, memory, ROM
==========
