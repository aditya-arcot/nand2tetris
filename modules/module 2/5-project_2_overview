== Project 2 ==
given - chips from Project 1
goal - build following chips (family of combinatorial chips)
- HalfAdder
- FullAdder
- Add16
- Inc16
- ALU
==========


== Half Adder ==
input - a, b
output - sum, carry

can be built using elementary gates
- Xor for sum
- And for carry

a b sum carry
0 0 0   0
0 1 1   0
1 0 1   0
1 1 0   1
==========


== Full Adder ==
input - a, b, c
output - sum, cary

can be built from 2 half-adders
==========


== 16-bit Adder ==
