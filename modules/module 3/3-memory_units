== memory ==
main memory - RAM, ...
- hardwired into motherboard
secondary memory - disks, ...

volatile - requires power for persistence
non-volatile - info persists without power

RAM
- stores both data, instructions for programs
- random access memory - each register can be accessed in same time, regardless of how many

perspective
- physical
- logical

focus of this course - RAM, logical perspective
==========


== register ==
most basic memory element

1-bit register can be expanded to store multiple bits

width (w) - 16 for this course

inputs - in (w), load (1)
output - out(w)

state (w) - value currently stored

reading value - probe out
writing value
- set in = v
- set load = 1
==========


Hardware Simulator clock can be manually advanced
- 2 advancements = 1 time out


== RAM unit ==
RAM abstraction
- sequence of n addressable registers, with addressees 0 to n-1
- at any given point of time, only 1 register in RAM is selected

address of register
- width = k = log_2(n) 

inputs - in (w), address (k), load (1)
output - out (w)

sequential chip with clocked behavior

reading from register i
- set address = i
- out emits state of register i

writing to register i
- set address = i
- set in - v
- set load = 1
==========


== RAM chips ==
name	n	k
RAM8	8	3
RAM64	64	6
RAM512	512	9
RAM4K	4096	12
RAM16K	16384	14i

will be used in Hack computer
