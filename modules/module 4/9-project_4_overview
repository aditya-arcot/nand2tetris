tasks
- simple algebraic program
- simple interactive program
  - keyboard, screen


== Mult ==
perform R2 = R0 * R1
only needs to satisfy R0 >= 0, R1 >= 0, and R0*R1 < 32768

use a loop to change multiplication problem to addition
==========


== Fill ==
fill screen while any key is pressed

infinite loop
listen to keyboard

testing
- select no animation
- manual testing (no test script)
==========


== best practice ==
short
efficient
elegant
self-describing
==========


== technical tips ==
use symbolic variables, labels
use sensible variable, label names
lower-case variables
upper-case labels
use indentation
start with pseudo code
==========
