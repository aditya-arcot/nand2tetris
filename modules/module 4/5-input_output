== peripheral I/O devices ==
ex: keyboard, screen

used for
- getting data from users
- displaying data to users

high-level approach
- sophisticated software libraries
- explored in Part II
low-level approach
- bits
==========


== screen memory map ==
area of RAM dedicated to manage display unit
used to continuously refresh physical display

Hack display unit
- 256 x 512 table of pixels
- black/white

16 bits x 8192 rows
- can only be accessed 16-bits at a time

Screen chip
- used for Hack computer
- behaves exactly like memory unit
- serves as memory map

to set pixel on/off
- word = Screen[32*row + col/16]
  - relative address (actual - Screen base address)
  - same as: word = RAM[16384 + 32*row + col/16]
- set (col % 16)th bit of word to 0 or 1
- commit word to RAM
==========


== keyboard memory map ==
Keyboard chip
- single 16-bit register
- RAM[24576] in Hack computer

key scan code appears in map when pressed
- 0 when no key pressed

to check currently-pressed key
- probe contents of Keyboard chip
