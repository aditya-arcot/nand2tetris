gate logic - technique for implementing boolean functions using logic gates


== logic gates ==
1+ inputs, 1 output


elementary
	NAND - if (a==1 and b==1) then out=0 else out=1
	AND
	OR
	NOT
composite - created using multiple elementary gates
	ex: 3-way AND


gate interface - shows inputs and output
	only 1 unique description
gate implementation - shows how the chip is constructed
	may be several possible
	dashed line shows boundary of chip (black box)

this course does not deal with physical implementations
	ex: circuits, transistors, relays
	scope of EE, not CS
