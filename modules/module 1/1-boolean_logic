boolean operations - AND, OR, NOT

boolean expressions - created using parenthesis

boolean functions - set number of inputs
	ex: f(x,y) = x AND y
	possible inputs, output can be specified in truth table 

boolean identities
	commutative laws
		x AND y = y AND x
		x OR y = y OR x
	associative laws
		x AND (y AND z) = (x AND y) AND z
		x OR (y OR z) = (x OR y) OR z
	distributive laws
		x AND (y OR z) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
		x OR (y AND z) = (x OR y) AND (x OR z)
	De Morgan laws
		NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)
		NOT(x OR y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y)

boolean algebra - can use identities to simplify expression
