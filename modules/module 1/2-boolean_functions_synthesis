== steps ==
convert truth table to boolean expression
	focus on rows with value of 1
	write an expression for each of the above rows
	combine expressions with OR
simplify expression


example:
x y z f
0 0 0 1 <- NOT(x) AND NOT(y) AND NOT(z)
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 <- NOT(x) AND y AND NOT(z)
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 <- x AND NOT(y) AND NOT(z)
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0

f(x) = (NOT(x) AND NOT(y) AND NOT(z)) OR (NOT(x) AND y AND NOT(z)) OR (x AND NOT(y) AND NOT(z))


any boolean function can be represented using an expression with only AND, OR, NOT
	unlike integer functions
	OR is also unnecessary - can be expressed using AND, NOT


== NAND ==
x y NAND
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 0

x NAND y = NOT(x AND y)

any boolean function can be represented using an expression with only NAND
	NOT(x) = x NAND x
	x AND y = NOT(x NAND y)
